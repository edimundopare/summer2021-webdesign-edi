:::HOW DO YOU BREAK STEREOTYPES WITH YOUR HOBBIE?:::::

I enjoy embracing my own biology of being a male human. That includes building muscle mass, having strong bones and feeling athletic. The pay off is heavy body weight and reduced flexibility.

Why then did I choose ballet as my hobby? Is ballet a hobby? 

Yes, ballet is a hobby. If you think of a hobby as an activity done regularly during your spare time for pleasure, then dance definitely fits the bill. It's an enjoyable pastime in which you can indulge whenever you're not busy, it relaxes you and helps you let your hair down (ref: https://www.arthurmurraycrowsnest.com.au/blog-posts/dance-tips/is-dancing-a-hobby-a-sport-fitness-trendnbspsocial-activity-skill-or-all-five)

But you're a man?

That's stereotype number 1. Male ballet dancers have traditionally been seen as girly. However, the muscle strength with a lean body surpasses men who play American foot-ball.
