    <p>At a glance, the book appears easy to follow along. A picture speaks of a thousand words type of
    material. Reader reviews elsewhere have mixed feelings. First, the publishing date November 2011 (c'mon!
    it's basically 2012) makes it outdated. Second, humans learn differently; thus, the book doesn't make everybody 
    happy. Is it then a good choice for a beginner?  I think so... </p>

    Don't you find the drawing of the cover pretty cool? I think it's a lemur. See the tail. 
    I loved the Oreilly series with awesome animal drawings.
    I'm sold with that. The book has bad reviews in other platforms. However, I am so happy to be formally introduced to
    the CSS language using the O'reilly learning platform on the best Articles and Databases of the SFPL. Thanks Eduardo (that's our teacher).

    <p>The bookcover is a rhino. Perfect for the definitive guide of any book. And this is what World leaders should ask themselves:
        <i>"Why bother?. </i>Pointing a finger, with a fatherly tone, King Soliman once said <i>"there's nothing new under the sun".</i> So, I'd grab the source code from a webpage and edit it. 
        In a made-in-China type of fashion. Copy, improve and make it cheaper. The book? Oh, yes. This book seems to give hands on exercises. Reader reviews rated it 4-5 stars!
