3. Header color: #F3E4F4 or #ESF0DF
4. Link: #F3E4F4 depending on 3 above

Carl Sagan Cosmos Lorem Ipsum
Galaxies Apollonius of Perga hundreds of thousands hydrogen atoms globular star cluster citizens of distant epochs. At the edge of forever kindling the energy hidden in matter the only home we've ever known courage of our questions a still more glorious dawn awaits great turbulent clouds? How far away Sea of Tranquility Sea of Tranquility rich in heavy atoms with pretty stories for which there's little good evidence something incredible is waiting to be known and billions upon billions upon billions upon billions upon billions upon billions upon billions.
